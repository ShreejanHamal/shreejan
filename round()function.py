#example of round function

a = 10.5
b = 5.2
c = round(a+b) 
print(c)



print(round(7)) # returns 7 as it is interger
print(round(7,2)) # returns 7 as it is also a int
print(round(7.61)) # returns 8 
print(round(1.2222333,2)) # returns 1.22 as ,2 represent 2 digit after point
print(round(1.22222,0)) # returns 1.0 as ,0 represent 0


print(round(11.5))
print(round(12.5))


print(round(789,2))# it will not effect number
